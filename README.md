# IGNITION-Hackaton
IGNITION | A Global Solana Hackathon from Dev Post

For this hackaton, I have teammed up with an amazing team as a game designer for the game that uses PVP mechanics.

1. The starting code is from this [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXI3hqTRnnE&ab_channel=ThirteeNov) - my now favorite channel

---------------------------- SCRATCH THIS TOP PART AND START FROM BELOW --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. I am teaming up with some Russians , one of them is [this guy](https://cryptoson.tech/) and the  start of my contribution is to reversd engineer some game :
<br>
= mechanic is pretty simple: the players will have a set of 4 cards each one representing a pair of rock, paper,  scissors on it. they must to choose 3 of them, once all players select their hand they will be confronted in duels.
<br>
= To win the duel a player must be the first in scores 2 points. the winner will pick a random card from the opponent and then move forward to the next round.
<br>
= The last player remaining in the game will win the ownership of the spaceship that represents them in that game. 
the Spaceship is a NFT, there is a collection of 13312 unique spaceships
